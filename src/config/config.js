			description: `Red hair, golden eyes with amber flecks, tanned skin.
		Giggly, bold and outgoing. Lili collects and spreads gossip, insults others, and is sensitive.
		However, she always wants to be the best, and tends to brag.
		She believes in making people smile and creating great stories and music, and plans to return to her village as a hero and the best performer - better than Miriam!`,
			backstory: `I grew up in the spotlight. Siren, they called me (which led to
		my nickname, Lili - being my first word).
		I lived in a small hut with my brothers and sisters:
		
		• David & Goliath (twin boy)
		• Summer & Winter (twin girls)
		• Sugar & Spice (twin girl and boy)
		• me & Jack (my full name is secret)
		• Leesa & Richard (nickname Dick)
		
		My life was filled with song and dance until Miriam came along.
		
		Her dancing entranced the whole village and before I knew it
		everyone had stopped asking for my songs.
		Even papa (Lee) and mama (Bea) didn't ask me to perform at their
		100th anniversary.
		I ran away.
		I told them the next time they see me I'll be not only the best
		artist in the world, but a hero as well.
		I can't wait to return and show Miriam who I really am! To
		remind me of my quest, I have a love letter from Merri, my ex
		girlfriend. She was with me when I discovered the magic of my
		music, and she too was swept away in Miriam's dancing.
		
		I'm not sure if I want her back or to ruin her life.`

		Bonds - her inner circle/the team she travels with and she is fond of a bat that has chosen to follow her around, she named him bug (short for bugger off) because she was always trying to get him to leave her alone but eventually grew to like him, she doesn’t know why he found her or stayed with her but he does… 
		
		Flaws - cynical, Pessimistic, untrusting of all people, takes a long time to break down her walls, can be prickly`,
			backstory: `Nova has grown up alone and has only known solitude for the majority of her life. Her entire family were slaughtered by the townspeople for being outcasts and she barely escaped with her life, she has a deep crescent shaped scar on her throat from this attack.
		
		She became a rogue because she had to fend for herself and steal to keep herself alive, She joined the team to defend the weak and strives to prevent anyone going through the suffering she has endured, she regrets her dark past and projects this hatred onto all thieves as a result, she has a kind heart although it may not seem that way at times.
		
		She prefers to go unseen and will hide in the shadows if she can.`
