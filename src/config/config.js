		{
			name: "Naz",
			img: naz,
			backstory: `Naz grew up in the slums of Blackchapel. She didn’t know her parents and begged for money. When she got older she had a scrap with some kids who tried to steal her pet rat, Fernando. She was spotted by another half-orc who ran a fighting ring in the sewers. He trained her as a fighter and she fought for him in his illegal fighting ring in the sewers where people come and go and make bets. She wins most of her money this way as she is very small for a half-orc so people tend to bet against her, but she rarely loses. Her mentor was a bit like a father but was distant and only saw her as a prized fighter. Although she hasn’t experience love she hopes one day she will. She works in kitchens for a stable salary since her race prevented her from education or any better job. She is wary of the other races. She dreams of escaping the slums and often looks up at the stars wishing for freedom and safety. She was working her day job back of house in the kitchen when she received a mysterious letter…`

			name: "Melody Grieves",
			img: nullPortrait,
			backstory: `Grieves is a 25 year old woman. She is 5’10 with an hourglass figure, but typically wears layered full-length robes and cheap jewels. She has the words ‘hello’ and ‘goodbye’ branded into each of her forearms and wears heart-shaped glasses at all times.

	Grieves was raised from infancy in an isolated village/colony subjected to the tyranny of an established diabolical vampire clan. Colony humans were typically good/neutral alignments, and resistant to effectively being used as cattle for vampires - but were threatened with annihilation in the circumstances that any villager should try to leave. Any villager who would leave the colony (and not return within the allotted time) would be tracked by the vampires, and their heads would shortly be mounted upon pikes fixed at the village entrance. 
	
	While being subjected to forceable feeding by a vampire at the age of 17, Grieves suggested that the feeding process could be improved through means of sex. During sex (and while being bitten) Grieves reactively returned the bite and consumed vampire blood to excess, consuming the curse and enraging the vampire feeding from her. Dictating death as too much of a mercy - the vampire cursed Grieves to be plagued with constant visions of the Hell which would await her. These visions render her blind (and, reasonably, traumatized.) She was then cast from the colony, unable to ever know her friends and family again.
	
	For 8 years, Grieves has been searching for redemption through religious means. She would join religious congregations of many kinds, hiding her true nature for fear of being hunted or shunned from the pious men she sought redemption from. However, her search has always resulted in the discovery of hidden sin and corruption in these institutions, and in these men - and inevitably her vampiric ability to seduce would lead to holy men casting her out for sin. 
	
	A year prior, Grieves met Finnian in her travels to find a new congregation. Confessing her visions of Hell and regular long spells of torment, Finnian fashioned an enchanted artifact in a pair of costume glasses found in an antique store. In owing him her sanity, she is beholden to his wishes and (inevitably) extremely fond of him. 
	
	Grieves is now seeking a less religious, and more practical, cure for her curse.`

I was cursed by the devil himself and have been embroiled in my own internal battle ever since I am kind hearted and polite and inherently wish to make good decisions and the right choices but the curse is trying to drag me into darkness and will stop at nothing to corrupt my heart and soul My inner conflict is symbolised by tattoo-like marks on my body, Every time I defy the curse and make the right choice, but not necessarily the easiest choice I am made to suffer! It is as though a flaming torch has been held to my skin and when the pain subsides I am forever marked, my sincere hope is that one day I will find the cure to my affliction and once again regain control of my soul. I was stopped at a tavern for some sustenance when I was approached by a mysterious stranger, they passed me a letter and left without a word
