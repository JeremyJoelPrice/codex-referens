				The Luminaris Custodes is a formidable and dedicated sect
				operating from the theocratic city-state of Paxsinistra. This
				organisation is known for its unyielding commitment to the
				faith, and its unwavering zeal in defending it. While their
				methods might appear ruthless to some, they see themselves as
				the stalwart protectors of the spiritual well-being of the
				realm.
				<br />
				<br />
				Despite their unrelenting pursuit of perceived evildoers, the
				Luminaris Custodes have historically played a crucial role in
				protecting the populace from genuine dangers. These threats
				include demonic incursions, dangerous cults, and supernatural
				menaces. Their actions are grounded in a sincere belief that
				they are acting in the greater good's, rather than aspiring for
				power or exhibiting malevolence. However, they are ruthless in
				apprehending and punishing perceived evildoers, including those
				accused of demonism, witchcraft, and anyone from a Tiefling
				bloodline.
