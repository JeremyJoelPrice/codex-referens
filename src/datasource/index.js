		name: "Mayonniase",
		img: mayPortrait,
		description: `May is 5’2, with a relatively stocky build. She has white skin, grey hair, grey eyes, rosy pink cheeks and lips.
		
Her personality is flighty. She is tender, caring and sweet - but these characteristics often stray into features of childishness, naïveté and ignorance. Although she does not typically lie for the sake of manipulation or personal gain, she is a liar.

Any person who might ask about her origin story will receive a different story every time, or a non-answer. She will claim to have forgotten her birth name.`,
		backstory: `May (more formally referred to as Mayonnaise) was born into a noble elven household - with the given birth name of Silvira Aegnor. Her mother, Islane, was family matriarch of the Aegnor Household - and married to Rothsmere, a fellow High Elf.

Silvira’s half-elf form may typically have cast great shame to Islane and her family. However, Islane’s notoriously powerful grasp of blood magic and threatening influence prevented any such shame from being voiced. Servants and nobles alike would refuse to acknowledge the circumstances of Silvira’s heritage - any who dared remark on her resemblance to her father would inevitably be found missing, hours or days from the incident.

Upon coming of age, Silvira’s own enquiries were met with continued refusals to acknowledge the truth, which she would inevitably face, each time she’d gaze into a mirror. With each passing day, she began to feel less and less committed to the continuity of her own narrative. Was Rothsmere her father? Was this her home - does she belong her? Is Silvira her real name?

Upon receiving notification that her household had accepted a marriage proposal from an elven household with a similar nobility standing, Silvira realised that she did not feel concerned. She did not feel excited, frightened or upset. She felt nothing, because she was not Silvira - this was not her name, her home, nor her engagement. She packed a satchel with all the things that she liked (because these things were the only truths that still held weight) and left in the night, riding a stolen horse.

For several weeks, she travelled lightly between taverns, earning shelter through musical performance and charm. The first true friend which she had made in her travels was a girthy tabby cat, who had accosted her outside a merchants hut. Upon inquisition, the merchant informed her that the cat was named Mayonnaise. This became her namesake.

Months later, May was travelling North to seek out a potential group of performers who were scouting for new recruits. She heard whimpering sounds emanating from within a cave which she was passing. Unwisely, May ventured inside the cave, and found a gigantic chasm within its depths. Near the edge of the chasm, she found the corpse of a rock giant. In its cold arms, a newborn baby - still small enough to toss - like a pebble.

May’s course redirected towards the nearest orphanage. All of these would flatly reject her offer of a rock giant baby - citing the continued struggle to adequately feed their current wards. People reacted to the baby with expressions of concern, or occasionally, disgust. May understood that, under these circumstances, she would be the ward between life and death. She chose life. She named the child Marilyn - after a bard, that had once complimented the baby’s bright green eyes.

May and Marilyn now continue their travels, in search of something. Largely, a family - a home - a purpose? But, for now, a warm place to sleep will suffice.`

		name: "Lili Nimblefoot",
		img: liliPortrait,
		description: `Red hair, golden eyes with amber flecks, tanned skin.
Giggly, bold and outgoing. Lili collects and spreads gossip, insults others, and is sensitive.
However, she always wants to be the best, and tends to brag.
She believes in making people smile and creating great stories and music, and plans to return to her village as a hero and the best performer - better than Miriam!`,
		backstory: `I grew up in the spotlight. Siren, they called me (which led to
my nickname, Lili - being my first word).
I lived in a small hut with my brothers and sisters:

• David & Goliath (twin boy)
• Summer & Winter (twin girls)
• Sugar & Spice (twin girl and boy)
• me & Jack (my full name is secret)
• Leesa & Richard (nickname Dick)

My life was filled with song and dance until Miriam came along.

Her dancing entranced the whole village and before I knew it
everyone had stopped asking for my songs.
Even papa (Lee) and mama (Bea) didn't ask me to perform at their
100th anniversary.
I ran away.
I told them the next time they see me I'll be not only the best
artist in the world, but a hero as well.
I can't wait to return and show Miriam who I really am! To
remind me of my quest, I have a love letter from Merri, my ex
girlfriend. She was with me when I discovered the magic of my
music, and she too was swept away in Miriam's dancing.

I'm not sure if I want her back or to ruin her life.`

		name: "Amara Galanodel",
		img: amaraPortrait,
		description: `A recent adult for an elf at 125 years old, she has pale
skin that almost has a blue-ish tinge to it.
Silver-white hair, and green eyes that have flecks of gold in them.
Her personality exudes a scrappy determination, as if she's constantly striving to prove her maturity. Thanks to her tough upbringing, it's incredibly challenging to offend her, leading her to adopt a sardonic sense of humour.
However, amidst her sarcasm, she harbours surprising kindness, though she reserves this genuine warmth for only a select few individuals whom she deems truly worthy, a distinction that's not easily earned in her eyes.`,
		backstory: `Acquired at birth by the local thieves guild and named for the bond she will have with the shadows and their work. Amara has a very close connection with the current guild master, and the “contacts” she has at the guild.

Life at the thieves guild isn’t for the weak, and she has some unresolved trauma from losing a very close “contact” before she reached adulthood.

Very early in life she discovered that she has a natural talent for adopting different identities, which she uses to help run multiple schemes. She uses her charisma and flattery to lure victims in, often these are wealthy nobility that the guild has targeted. Amara publicly invokes Tymora but has a secret deity that she also invokes, but has never done so in public.

She is hoping to find an identity that she can use eternally, and move away from her life in the shadows.`

		backstory: `Nova has grown up alone and has only known solitude for the majority of her life. Her entire family were slaughtered by the townspeople for being outcasts and she barely escaped with her life, she has a deep crescent shaped scar on her throat from this attack.

She became a rogue because she had to fend for herself and steal to keep herself alive, She joined the team to defend the weak and strives to prevent anyone going through the suffering she has endured, she regrets her dark past and projects this hatred onto all thieves as a result, she has a kind heart although it may not seem that way at times.

She prefers to go unseen and will hide in the shadows if she can.`

		name: "Volrin Ironspring",

		description: ``,
		backstory: `(Work In Progress)
He lived in a volcanic mountain alongside other gnomes and dwarves. Within this mountain was a great source of heat (hence volcanic, but could also be magical or down to a dragon, possibilities are open, can leave thst to your discretion).

The gnomes and drawves within the mountain worked together to forge and produce metal goods (armours, weapons, robots, steam machines etc) using the heat from the mountain. They all lived harmoniously, until one day the big bad enemy (either an army or a group led by a leader) began fracking the mountain for its minerals and rare metals that the dwarves and gnomes used to build.

The gnomes and dwarves that were trained tried to fight, whilst the others (mine included) were forced out of the mountain and away from their homes. Many of them settled together others went seeking revenge`
