	description: `A recent adult for an elf at 125 years old, she has pale
skin that almost has a blue-ish tinge to it.
Silver-white hair, and green eyes that have flecks of gold in them.
Her personality exudes a scrappy determination, as if she's constantly striving to prove her maturity. Thanks to her tough upbringing, it's incredibly challenging to offend her, leading her to adopt a sardonic sense of humour.
However, amidst her sarcasm, she harbours surprising kindness, though she reserves this genuine warmth for only a select few individuals whom she deems truly worthy, a distinction that's not easily earned in her eyes.`,
	backstory: `Acquired at birth by the local thieves guild and named for the bond she will have with the shadows and their work. Amara has a very close connection with the current guild master, and the “contacts” she has at the guild.

Life at the thieves guild isn’t for the weak, and she has some unresolved trauma from losing a very close “contact” before she reached adulthood.

Very early in life she discovered that she has a natural talent for adopting different identities, which she uses to help run multiple schemes. She uses her charisma and flattery to lure victims in, often these are wealthy nobility that the guild has targeted. Amara publicly invokes Tymora but has a secret deity that she also invokes, but has never done so in public.

She is hoping to find an identity that she can use eternally, and move away from her life in the shadows.`
