	description: `Red hair, golden eyes with amber flecks, tanned skin.
Giggly, bold and outgoing. Lili collects and spreads gossip, insults others, and is sensitive.
However, she always wants to be the best, and tends to brag.
She believes in making people smile and creating great stories and music, and plans to return to her village as a hero and the best performer - better than Miriam!`,
	backstory: `I grew up in the spotlight. Siren, they called me (which led to
my nickname, Lili - being my first word).
I lived in a small hut with my brothers and sisters:

• David & Goliath (twin boy)
• Summer & Winter (twin girls)
• Sugar & Spice (twin girl and boy)
• me & Jack (my full name is secret)
• Leesa & Richard (nickname Dick)

My life was filled with song and dance until Miriam came along.

Her dancing entranced the whole village and before I knew it
everyone had stopped asking for my songs.
Even papa (Lee) and mama (Bea) didn't ask me to perform at their
100th anniversary.
I ran away.
I told them the next time they see me I'll be not only the best
artist in the world, but a hero as well.
I can't wait to return and show Miriam who I really am! To
remind me of my quest, I have a love letter from Merri, my ex
girlfriend. She was with me when I discovered the magic of my
music, and she too was swept away in Miriam's dancing.

I'm not sure if I want her back or to ruin her life.`
