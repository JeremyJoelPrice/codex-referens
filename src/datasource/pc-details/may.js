	description: `May is 5’2, with a relatively stocky build. She has white skin, grey hair, grey eyes, rosy pink cheeks and lips.
	
Her personality is flighty. She is tender, caring and sweet - but these characteristics often stray into features of childishness, naïveté and ignorance. Although she does not typically lie for the sake of manipulation or personal gain, she is a liar.

Any person who might ask about her origin story will receive a different story every time, or a non-answer. She will claim to have forgotten her birth name.`,
	backstory: `May (more formally referred to as Mayonnaise) was born into a noble elven household - with the given birth name of Silvira Aegnor. Her mother, Islane, was family matriarch of the Aegnor Household - and married to Rothsmere, a fellow High Elf.

Silvira’s half-elf form may typically have cast great shame to Islane and her family. However, Islane’s notoriously powerful grasp of blood magic and threatening influence prevented any such shame from being voiced. Servants and nobles alike would refuse to acknowledge the circumstances of Silvira’s heritage - any who dared remark on her resemblance to her father would inevitably be found missing, hours or days from the incident.

Upon coming of age, Silvira’s own enquiries were met with continued refusals to acknowledge the truth, which she would inevitably face, each time she’d gaze into a mirror. With each passing day, she began to feel less and less committed to the continuity of her own narrative. Was Rothsmere her father? Was this her home - does she belong her? Is Silvira her real name?

Upon receiving notification that her household had accepted a marriage proposal from an elven household with a similar nobility standing, Silvira realised that she did not feel concerned. She did not feel excited, frightened or upset. She felt nothing, because she was not Silvira - this was not her name, her home, nor her engagement. She packed a satchel with all the things that she liked (because these things were the only truths that still held weight) and left in the night, riding a stolen horse.

For several weeks, she travelled lightly between taverns, earning shelter through musical performance and charm. The first true friend which she had made in her travels was a girthy tabby cat, who had accosted her outside a merchants hut. Upon inquisition, the merchant informed her that the cat was named Mayonnaise. This became her namesake.

Months later, May was travelling North to seek out a potential group of performers who were scouting for new recruits. She heard whimpering sounds emanating from within a cave which she was passing. Unwisely, May ventured inside the cave, and found a gigantic chasm within its depths. Near the edge of the chasm, she found the corpse of a rock giant. In its cold arms, a newborn baby - still small enough to toss - like a pebble.

May’s course redirected towards the nearest orphanage. All of these would flatly reject her offer of a rock giant baby - citing the continued struggle to adequately feed their current wards. People reacted to the baby with expressions of concern, or occasionally, disgust. May understood that, under these circumstances, she would be the ward between life and death. She chose life. She named the child Marilyn - after a bard, that had once complimented the baby’s bright green eyes.

May and Marilyn now continue their travels, in search of something. Largely, a family - a home - a purpose? But, for now, a warm place to sleep will suffice.`
