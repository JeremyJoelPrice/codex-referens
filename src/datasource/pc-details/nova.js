Ideals - thieves deserve no mercy, helping the helpless, defending the weak

Bonds - her inner circle/the team she travels with and she is fond of a bat that has chosen to follow her around, she named him bug (short for bugger off) because she was always trying to get him to leave her alone but eventually grew to like him, she doesn’t know why he found her or stayed with her but he does… 

Flaws - cynical, Pessimistic, untrusting of all people, takes a long time to break down her walls, can be prickly`,
	backstory: `Nova has grown up alone and has only known solitude for the majority of her life. Her entire family were slaughtered by the townspeople for being outcasts and she barely escaped with her life, she has a deep crescent shaped scar on her throat from this attack.

She became a rogue because she had to fend for herself and steal to keep herself alive, She joined the team to defend the weak and strives to prevent anyone going through the suffering she has endured, she regrets her dark past and projects this hatred onto all thieves as a result, she has a kind heart although it may not seem that way at times.

She prefers to go unseen and will hide in the shadows if she can.`
