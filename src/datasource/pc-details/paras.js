	backstory: `Paras Akali Baaj (true name is only known by his parents, the scripture reader present at his naming ceremony and his goblin friend). 
	Growing up between Wallah, the working class half-race migrant quarter of Paxsinistra, and the rural villages in the Echomora mountain foothills where his family hail, Paras devoted himself to study to provide a better life for his hard working parents that toil away at menial jobs for the service of Paxsinistra’s citizens. An interest in religion driven by his exposure to the various races of the migrant quarter led to the study of religious scripture and language, and a natural progression to magic scripture.


While Paras was tempted to follow other teens into the common past time of petty theft, and convinced himself that given the circumstances of those in Wallah it would almost be the moral thing to do, his desire to become a master wizard through admittance into the top colleges of Paxsinistra triumphed. This enabled Paras to learn through observation the various ways of to survive and navigate the bustling city through good actions, bad actions and the justified actions, without having to engage himself in the risks or rewards of either activity.

As Paras entered his early adult years, his daily life experience began to straddle an ever widening societal gap. In the afternoons, his shoes softly and confidently clacked against marble floors as he strode with purpose carrying his religious and spell scriptures with his his head held heigh, while in the mornings and evenings, his heels crunched beneath the discarded meat bones and rags that littered and defined Wallah’s paths, as he travelled from childhood home to the hallowed halls of The Grove, the leading school of wizardy within Paxsinistra. This jarring difference in reality between the hours of sunset and sunrise fine tuned Paras observation and mimicry, enabling him to elicit the trust of various races from across the wide class hierarchy by simply not raising a sliver of suspicion as to whether he belonged to whomever he spoke to. However, beneath this friendly allure, sat an egotistical drive to prove that he is the greatest.

This drive, ability to be at home with various races, observation of survival methods within both the slums and ivory towers, and half-elf background drew the attention of the crown agent’s spy service. Paras desire to support his family and be away from the receiving end of state driven discrimination as an outcast race, turned the crown’s interest mutual. What followed was a life of constant movement, isolation from his own family, medals for innovation within spycraft, and facial scarring with hints of dark magic that Paras’ simply describes as the result of ego. Paras time during these years of service to the crown are shrouded in secrecy. Perhaps more so due to guilt than fear of violating swears upon the Pope. What is known is that Paras developed a close companionship to a Goblin, a true and loving friendship that was not driven by the crown’s desire for espionage, and that this is what he holds as he most cherished memory of that period – more so than the Crown Spy General’s praise for his innovations in spycraft.

Paras has now left the crown but is unable to drop the habit of constant movement, travelling back and forth between his ancestral foothill village and his parent’s home of Wallah, accompanied by his red kite, without any purpose other than to keep moving to avoid thinking. When the weather is too poor to travel beyond the city or his parents require assistance, Paras settles on Elf vision assisted night walks around the city outskirts, part hoping to make it around the walls without being spotted by the guards as a testament to his natural talents and part hoping to be halted so he can flash his Paxsinistran Crown Guard Medal in his slender half-elf hands as a testament to his unnatural status and success.`
