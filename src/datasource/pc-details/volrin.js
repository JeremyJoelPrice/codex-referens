	backstory: `Volrin lived in the volcano Archaedra alongside other gnomes and dwarves. Within this mountain was a great source of heat said to come from a mythical dragon deep below.

The gnomes and dwarves within the mountain worked together to forge and produce metal goods (armours, weapons, steam machines etc) using the semi-magical heat from the mountain. They all lived harmoniously, until one day a mysterious invading army began fracking the mountain for its minerals and rare metals that the dwarves and gnomes used to build.

The gnomes and dwarves that were trained tried to fight, whilst the others (mine included) were forced out of the mountain and away from their homes. Many of them settled together others went seeking revenge`
