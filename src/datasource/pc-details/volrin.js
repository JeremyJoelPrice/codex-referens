	description: `Volrin has medium length brown scruffy hair that stands on end. A pair of wooden framed glasses adorn his face, seemingly balanced on his curled moustache, two pale blue marbles gaze intently from behind them. Hanging from his mouth is an intricate pipe carefully cobbled out of beech, from which a large plume of thick smoke billows into the air.

A filthy green cloak fails to distract from the old patchworked leather armour it pretends to hide. Various bags and objects are hung from seemingly random fixtures containing various miscalenous powders and bright liquids. A belt fashioned out what appears to be some sort of vine tightly holds everything together around a meek frame which stands not much higher than a meter.

His worked fingers curl around a jagged wooden staff as if it were an extension to his arm. Various scriptures have been carved into it in some unknown language made up of small runic symbols. A oak shield almost big enough to engulf him is tied to his right arm to protect him from harms way.

Volrin is erratic and finicky, he always seems to be in a rush even for the most menial of tasks. Authority doesn't mean anything to a man who's spent his life foraging to feed and heal those suffering in his home inside Mount Archaedra. He has a dry sense of humour and seemingly cares more for the world around him as opposed to his own wellbeing. Volrin can not bare to see any injustice as to him all living life should be valued the same. However when he was forced from his home by a mysterious dark army as they destroyed the world he had so carefully cultivated, a fire was lit within Volrin who vowed to restore it to its natural order.`,
	backstory: `Volrin lived in the volcano Archaedra alongside other gnomes and dwarves. Within this mountain was a great source of heat said to come from a mythical dragon deep below.

The gnomes and dwarves within the mountain worked together to forge and produce metal goods (armours, weapons, steam machines etc) using the semi-magical heat from the mountain. They all lived harmoniously, until one day a mysterious invading army began fracking the mountain for its minerals and rare metals that the dwarves and gnomes used to build.

The gnomes and dwarves that were trained tried to fight, whilst the others (mine included) were forced out of the mountain and away from their homes. Many of them settled together others went seeking revenge`
